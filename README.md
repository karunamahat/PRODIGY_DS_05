TASK-05:
Analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. Visualize accident hotspots and contributing factors.

Solution:

This project analyzes traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. The analysis aims to understand accident hotspots and contributing factors using data visualization techniques. The analysis is conducted using Python in Jupyter Notebook for data cleaning and preparation, and the cleaned data is then visualized using Power BI to create a dashboard.

Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis contains information about traffic accidents, including the date and time of the accident, road conditions, weather conditions, and contributing factors. The dataset was cleaned and prepared for analysis in Jupyter Notebook before being imported into Power BI for visualization.

Process
Data Cleaning and Preparation: The dataset was cleaned to remove any irrelevant information and to prepare the data for analysis. This included handling missing values, formatting dates and times, and categorizing road and weather conditions.

Data Analysis: The cleaned data was analyzed to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. This analysis was done using Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy in Jupyter Notebook.

Visualization in Power BI: The cleaned and analyzed data was imported into Power BI to create visualizations. Visualizations included maps showing accident hotspots, charts showing the distribution of accidents by road and weather conditions, and graphs showing the time of day when accidents are most likely to occur.
